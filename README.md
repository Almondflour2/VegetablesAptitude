 # VegetablesAptitude: Vegetable Aptitude Test
 
 
 A personality test written in C# to supply 
 a mysterious, ominous, and totally factual
 definition of your soul transcribed to a 
 vegetable. 

 Running instructions:
 open VegetablesAptitude.csproj in 
 Visual Studio and press the debug
 green arrow button. 

 Logic:
 Main program - a menu loop that
 Uses a class called "quiz" to 
 define 'takers' as an instance
 of the quiz class, and then uses
 a questions method to read in 
 questions from a text file. 
 The result is generated from	
 3 traits that are processed and
 scored differently through the use
 of if and switch case statements,
 and a vegetable that is randomly
 generated and read in through a text
 file. The 'takers' are stored in a 
 list and can be re-read from the 
 main menu using a LINQ query. 

 Thanks for checking my proggie out,
 hope you have fun, veggie...!
