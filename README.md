 # VegetablesAptitude: Vegetable Aptitude Test
 
 
 A personality test written in C# to supply 
 a mysterious, ominous, and totally factual
 definition of your soul transcribed to a 
 vegetable. 

 Running instructions:
 open VegetablesAptitude.csproj in 
 Visual Studio and press the debug
 green arrow button. 

 Logic:\
-Menu/Master Loop\
-Stores 'takers' in a list of instances of Quiz class\
-Stores questions in a list in order to randomize them and then return them to an array\
-LINQ query to find taker in list of previous takers of quiz\
-Imports data from text file to populate questions & list of vegetables

 Main program - a menu loop that\
 Uses a class called "quiz" to\
 define 'takers' as an instance\
 of the quiz class, and then uses\
 a questions method to read in \
 questions from a text file.\
 The result is generated from	\
 3 traits that are processed and\
 scored differently through the use\
 of if and switch case statements,\
 and a vegetable that is randomly\
 generated and read in through a text\
 file. The 'takers' are stored in a \
 list and can be re-read from the \
 main menu using a LINQ query.

 Thanks for checking my proggie out,
 hope you have fun, veggie...!
